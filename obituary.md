    <p align="justify"><b>James Taylor</b> (1979-2020) was an iconic professor in the CMDB department known for his eclectic taste in music, noteworthy shoes, wheeled-transportation, chill demeanor, dedicated skit performances, solid food recommendations, and especially his ardent support of his students and colleagues.</p>
    <p align="justify">James was a pioneer in integrating biology and computer science throughout his training and career. He attended the University of Vermont, earning his B.S. in Computer Science in 2000. After working in industry for several years, he began his Ph.D. studies in the Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Pennsylvania State University under the mentorship of Webb Miller and Francesca Chiaromonte. By encoding multi-species alignments and incorporating computational clustering, search, and learning algorithms, he identified novel regulatory regions in the genome that were frequently validated by subsequent studies. At Penn State, James worked with Anton Nekrutenko and others to start the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/jxtx/">Galaxy project</a>, an online platform for open and reproducible data analysis. After finishing his Ph.D. in three years, he continued on to New York University where, as a visiting member of the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences, he continued developing Galaxy further. </p>
    <p align="justify">James established his lab at Emory University in the Departments of Biology and Mathematics & Computer Science in 2008. He continued as a lead of the Galaxy project and worked to understand the 3D organization of the genome and gene regulation. In 2013, he was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. Moving to Johns Hopkins University in 2014, James was named the Ralph S. O’Connor Professor of Biology and Computer Science and was promoted to Professor in 2018. While at JHU, James was a PI for AnVIL, a large NIH initiative to provide genomic researchers with cloud-based resources for genomic data access, sharing and computing. In addition to Galaxy, AnVIL, and JHU collaborations, James provided his expertise to numerous committees, advisory boards, and consortiums throughout the field to advance scientific knowledge and reproducibility.</p>
    <p align="justify">A cornerstone of the CMDB community, James was an integral member of the department’s recruitment, hiring, and thesis committees, involved in numerous collaborations, and a fantastic instructor who shared his love of computational biology and dedication to reproducible science with all new trainees. Upon joining the faculty in 2014, he created and led a summer bootcamp and weekly lab course within the graduate curriculum to teach students computational biology and open, reproducible data analysis. The course served as many of these students’ first introduction to coding, and James received an Excellence in Graduate Teaching award in 2019 to honor his work on it.</p>
    <p align="justify">Aside from his formal responsibilities, James excitedly discussed science, experimental design (including the need for many replicates), and ways to improve teaching with many in the department. He welcomed high school and undergrad summer students into his lab with the purpose of teaching them coding and exciting them about science, and made an effort to advocate for under-represented minorities and women in STEM whenever possible. Finally, as a mentor, James supported a vibrant and unconventional community of <a href="https://taylorlab.org/">Galaxy and research personnel in his lab</a>, enabling each member to thrive by providing space to try things and confidence in his students’ abilities. He treated each member as a colleague and offered encouragement in the face of difficulties and celebration of even minor successes. James did not self-promote, but he continuously promoted and supported future scientists, his colleagues, and his students.</p>
    <p align="justify">As a close, here is some quintessential advice and words of wisdom from James:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Simplicity in all things.</li>
        <li>Go back to the data.</li>
        <li>Inbreeding is great! . . . Wait. Please quote me in context.*</li>
        <li>Good ideas don’t have owners—they belong to everyone.</li>
        <li>Try it first and see.</li>
        <li>You’re not ‘guessing’. That’s a nasty word. You’re inferring in a completely rigorous way.</li>
        <li>Hope!</li>
        </ul>
    <p align="justify">*With regards to this quote, at the time, James did ask to be quoted in context, so here it is. In the Spring 2019 Quantitative Biology and Biophysics course (which James organized and taught several lectures for), he asked for examples which would cause a population to have less than complete gene flow. A student answered with inbreeding, and in classic James excitement, his response created a lasting memory for the 2018 cohort.</p>
