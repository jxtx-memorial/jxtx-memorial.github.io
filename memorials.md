 	<p align="justify">James Taylor was such a vital and energetic force, I am still at a complete loss for words for this unthinkable tragedy. James and I have known each other for more than a decade, as mentor, boss, colleague, and friend. In the beginning, we decided to take a chance on each other, me as his first student, he as my advisor. I have never looked back. James was an inspiring person, showing you the breadcrumbs leading down an interesting path, and then watching you follow them with encouragement and confidence to a place neither of you had been before. I think one of his most amazing traits was to maintain his sense of wonder and excitement well past when most of us begin to lose it. The outpouring of love and support in the wake of this show just how many people he has inspired and helped with his boundless enthusiasm and vision.</p>
	<p align="justify">But more than losing an amazing boss and scientific juggernaut, I am going to miss the James that many fewer people got to see or know. There were special moments, on a long ride to a conference, chatting over a beer, or sometimes in the most unexpected situations when "Science James" would slip away and playful geek would come out on full display, whether discussing comic books, the singularity, Doctor Who, music, books, and anything else in his extensive catalog of personal interests. He always felt like the coolest and nicest person that you wanted nothing more than to please and be liked by.</p>
	<p align="justify">The graduate students at his first professorship nicknamed him 'the rock star'. I don't know if they ever realized how accurate and far from the truth at the same time this was. If anyone had an amazing sense of style and presence, from the shoes up, it was James. But he was also a humble and soft-spoke person, never looking to steal the spotlight or dominate. Instead, he was an advocate, both for those he personally worked with, and for all of the scientific community, pushing for honesty, fairness, transparency, responsibility, accessibility, and reproducibility.</p>
	<p align="justify">While his loss is a wound that may never heal, I am immeasurably enriched for having known, learned from, worked with, and shared so much of my life with James. Thank you for everything.</p>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">Even before I joined his lab, I looked up to James. I saw him and his lab members as pinnacles of unattainable success that I did not even dare to dream of. Beyond his professional success, James’ charisma and subtlety had an enchanting effect on everyone who interacted with him. While very few of us truly knew him well, everyone in the department talked about him as if he was the hottest celebrity in town. In any conversation or meeting James would always say the least, but the few words he did say were so on-point that everyone intently listened in on everything he had to say.</p>
	<p align="justify">After I joined his lab, James turned out to be exactly the opposite of what one might expect from a P.I. of his position - he was incredibly patient, laid back, and always easy going. From the beginning, the vibe I got from James was that he thought I did not need his help because he believed I could already do great things. While admittedly this was sometimes a source of frustration, his hands-off style somehow only inspired everyone in his lab to achieve that greatness. It was this strange and unique “James Taylor” mentoring style that distinguished his lab from the department. Despite no explicit expectations and deadlines, I worked my butt off just to prove to myself and James that he made the right choice by taking me into his lab. This resulted in the strangest and most amazing work environment I’ve ever seen. On one hand, we played video games in the meeting room during work hours, watched movies, played D&D, and flew drones around the lab – I think many outsiders probably thought that’s all we did. And yet when it came to science, the lab was <b><i>on</i></b> – everyone worked their hardest to deliver their A-game. I believe that this was James’ greatest achievement as a mentor and leader – he created an environment people were truly happy to be in, populated it with people he believed in, and then <b><i>trusted</i> </b>them to be the best. To create this kind of environment in any workspace, let alone Johns Hopkins, was just remarkable. I feel incredibly fortunate to have been a part part of it.</p>
	<p align="justify">James Taylor and the magic that he brought to the entire department can never be replaced. He was an integral part to my life at Johns Hopkins and I will miss him dearly. The last email I got from him, just a few days before his passing, was my thesis defense form with his signature on it. Somehow I think of it as one last blessing from him, telling me to take what I learned from him and achieve greatness just as he had. I am devastated that can’t go back and visit him to tell him how I am doing, and to show him that he was correct to believe in me. I can only move forward, continuing to prove to myself that he made the right choice. To make him proud.</p>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">I’ve written about four of these tribute responses to James so far and I’m still struggling to find the right words. James was brilliant, kind, magnanimous, and supportive, and a great force for good in academia and the world.</p>
	<p align="justify">As I continue my work I keep thinking “I should send this result to James,” and “I wonder if James has any ideas on how to solve this problem” and then reality comes crashing back in. It’s still hard for me to believe. It is cruel and unjust that he was taken from us so soon.</p>
	<p align="justify">James gave me a chance in his lab when I was at my lowest point of graduate school, he believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself. As I transitioned into his lab, James was unbelievably patient, and the lab environment he fostered was so welcoming. His leadership was understated and incredibly effective, both at generating results and at creating an environment where people would work hard because they were given the freedom to find problems that they were interested in and the support to tackle them head on.</p>
	<p align="justify">I’m so grateful to James and his lab for everything. Thank you James.</p>
	<b>—Nathan Roach</b>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">Many people know James as an advocate for transparency, and Galaxy as his way of trying to make it easy for people to be honest and clear about the work that they have done. The thing that I admired the most about James is that he paired this quality with a willingness to entertain crazy ideas. Being both a proponent of strict rigor but also willing to support a project that isn't risk free and would take years to yield fruit made him one of the best scientists I ever worked with, and and will ever work with. He carved out a place in the department to be weird. Thank you, and rest in peace.</p>

	<p align="justify">James was a cornerstone of the department and of the scientific community. But most of all he was the exemplar of a colleague and just a
wonderful human being.</p>
	<b>—Vince Hilser</b>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">James Taylor was a true scientific trailblazer in the Department of Biology. He single-handedly brought computational biology to the forefront of the department, enlightening our students and faculty to new ways of analyzing data. Since his arrival, other like-minded computational and quantitative scientists have joined our department, growing the seed that James had started. James’s impact reached far beyond science as he brought a true sense of collegiality, always available to collaborate and help to tackle a scientific challenge.</p>
	<p align="justify">James and his lab were the best collaborators that I’ve ever had. Available and interested at a moment’s notice, James always wanted to be part of the scientific adventure. James worked with our group to analyze gene expression, characterize transcription factor binding sites, identify natural variants and associate them with phenotypes, sequence genomes, and determine genome organization in the nucleus. James always cited his mentors’ advice that the goal of an excellent computational biologist is to be the best middle author. James achieved this goal, time and time again. He truly helped the Johnston lab achieve more than I ever could have imagined and I am eternally grateful.</p>
	<p align="justify">Beyond being a tremendous scientist and collaborator, James was a true friend. James, the cool, chill, long-haired computational scientist was the yin to my hyper, anxious, balding biology yang. His door was always open to listen to my worries as a pre-tenure professor. He was truly giving and supportive. For every paper and every grant, he sincerely congratulated me with a big smile. He talked about how special it was that we were all a part of this amazing department, that was uniquely supportive in the very competitive world of science. Beyond scientific chats, James was always up for a fun, nerdy debate about superheroes, punk rock music, or video games. James was an amazing colleague, scientist, and friend. I love him like a brother and I miss him very much.</p>
	<b>—Bob Johnston</b>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">James was incredibly talented, and very generous with assisting others. I know my lab and I benefited greatly from his help. His faith in me, and especially my student Jeremiah, emboldened us to pursue exciting work we would not have pursued without his encouragement. The impact of James's support and guidance on me and my students is incalculable.</p>
	<p align="justify">I had less to offer in return, but to thank him for his kind generosity, I made sure to give him choice roles in the annual CMDB faculty skit. When I first cast him in a Game of Thrones role, I mentioned he was in good shape, and jokingly asked if he would be willing to perform shirtless. He politely declined, so I decided to try again, and asked if he would be willing to AT LEAST perform sleeveless. Despite his shy tendencies, James agreed, so I made sure to cast him in sleeveless roles in future performances. While his thespian skills were perhaps slightly less refined than his amazing computational abilities, James was always willing to give a sleeveless 110% effort, which was appreciated by both myself, and the students.</p>
	<p align="justify">I regret I will not be able to cast him in future roles as sleeveless action stars and super heroes, but more importantly, I will regret not having him here with us on this planet. James really didn’t need me to make him into a fictional super-star. He was one in real life, and he will be missed.</p>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">I am so sad for this loss of my mentor, colleague, and friend. James is one of the main reasons that I came to Hopkins in 2018, as well as one of the main reasons that the experience has been so positive.</p>
	<p align="justify">Through his efforts in our department, James demonstrated the relevance and value of quantitative and computational research to all areas of biology. He dedicated his life’s work to developing tools and platforms to make computational genomic research more accessible, reliable, and robust—challenging gatekeeping in all its forms.</p>
	<p align="justify">As my faculty advisor, James’s calming demeanor was essential to navigating the imposter-syndrome-inducing experience of launching a new lab. Beyond any specific pieces of guidance or feedback, James gave me confidence based on the knowledge that someone I respected so much believed in me and had my back.</p>
	<p align="justify">This is a huge loss on multiple levels, which we will feel for years to come. I am meanwhile encouraged by the fact that the community he built and principles for which he advocated are here to stay.</p>

	<p align="justify">“Mesa James James Binks. Isa invented Galaxy software. The key to the bioinformaticsa universa!”</p>
	<p align="justify">Above is a line recited by James from the Star Wars themed faculty skit written and directed by Bob Johnston and performed altogether at the 2016 retreat. Despite his seemingly shy nature, James acted so professionally. We laughed and giggled, all throughout the practice dressed up in awkward costumes and the actual performance was a big hit. It’s one of my now achingly fond memories of James. I only wish I was given another chance to act with James, to share and build the fun memories together.</p>
	<p align="justify">James organized the quantitative biophysics course for CMDB grad students starting 2019. The course involved five different instructors who weren’t quite sure what needed to be taught. James contributed the most lectures into the course while running all the Friday lab modules with the TAs. Even up to March 28th of this year, he emailed all the instructors, kindly guiding us on how to slack message the students and how to prepare for zoom lectures etc.</p>
	<p align="justify">James was a calm presence… like a steadily positioned star in Galaxy. His stellar science will remain with us and instruct us on the myriad of ways of analyzing genomic sequences. I miss him and regret not interacting him more.</p>

	<p align="justify">In Appreciation of James Taylor</p>
	<p align="justify">My office was a few doors down from James’ office, and it is hard to imagine not running in to him anymore.  James brought contemporary genomics into the Biology Department, forging a crucial, new scientific direction. We had started to build a relationship based on shared interests in the epigenome, talking about the NIH 4D nucleome program, and exploring ways to collaborate on genome-wide transcription factor interactions. I greatly appreciated James’ insights and his open approach to science, and particularly his desire to be embedded next to colleagues on the experimental side for dialogue and collaboration.</p>
	<p align="justify">To lose a young colleague at the height of his career is very hard to accept. I saw James as a key part of our department’s future and so admired and appreciated his scholarship. And that includes his ‘cool dude’ persona. James’ impact on our science and our students is indelible, his spirit remains vivid in our minds, and we will honor him by continuing to build on his legacy and the kind of biology he envisioned for the coming generation of students and colleagues.</p>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">I shared the floor with James for the past 3.5 years. My encounters with him were brief, but always involved an exchange of smiles, which somehow assured me that I'm doing okay. I admired his scientific achievements, no-nonsense attitude, and fashion sense. I still cannot believe that he is gone.</p>
	<b>—Yumi Kim</b>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">It is extremely difficult to accept that James is gone. James and I joined the Biology department around the same time. It has been amazing get to know him and to see how quickly he became such a towering presence in the department through his genuineness, dedication and generosity. I will miss him very much as a scientist to look up to, as a thoughtful voice, as my unofficial retreat skit partner, and as James Taylor.</p>
	<b>—Christian Kaiser</b>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">My lab discovered Galaxy years ago, before I knew who had invented it.  It was fantastic-we could analyze our Genomics and RNAseq data without needing to write code or find a bioinformaticist to help out.  I later heard about James through Victor Corces, who had hired him at Emory and collaborated with him on 3D chromatin analysis. Later yet, I was on a biology Genomics faculty search committee, which eventually resulted in hiring James, poaching him away from Emory.  I had wanted the department to hire a Genomicist for a long time, and James was a fantastic choice.  Suddenly, all of our graduate students could get training in Bioinformatics, starting with a Boot Camp when they first arrived.</p>
	<p align="justify">My lab collaborated with James’ lab on study of a long non-coding RNA, TAPAS, we had discovered in the TERT promoter.  Through analysis of the cancer genetic atlas, a surprising discovery was that either TERT or TAPAS was expressed in most primary tumors;  rarely, they were both expressed.  Additional data suggested that TAPAS negatively regulates TERT.  This work was published in Non-coding RNA  in early 2018 (Malhotra et al.).  I remember it was sometimes hard to find James to discuss the data-I heard that he used to hang out at the Zoo.</p>
	<p align="justify">More recently, we were collaborating on an extension of this work, looking at the 3D architecture of the TERT gene and planning to co-mentor a new graduate student.  His untimely death was a huge shock and I am greatly saddened by it.</p>
	<p align="justify">James was very generous with his abundant knowledge-he gave a guest lecture in my graduate seminar class on RNA this past February.  He was in his element, answering students’ questions and pushing for reproducibility.  The class honored him with a moment of silence (on Zoom) after his death.</p>
	<p align="justify">James was inspiring and he was fun, amazingly creative and a big thinker. His creation, Galaxy, was truly a gift to science, allowing novices into the world of Genomics. He was a fabulous addition to the department and to the field. I am happy that I had a chance to collaborate with him-although it was too short.  He will be greatly missed.</p>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">There were many qualities that made James stand out besides his flowing hair and excellent choice in shoes. Two that stick with me were his dedication to teaching and his genuine demeanor. In class, James would do his best to standardize intermediate to complex computational theories for a group of students from diverse experience backgrounds. He made every effort to make information accessible to everyone, and you could see the satisfaction in his face when it was clear that people understood. This was well-complemented by his openness to the department. From sitting in his office with the door open and music playing to greetings in the hallway, James maintained a connection to those around him. Some of my favorite moments with James happened at department retreats where he mingled right alongside the grad students and went all-out for his role in the faculty skit. In all facets, James was a great professor and human being. While I’m saddened by his passing, I am thankful to have had the opportunity to get to know such an impactful person. His legacy lives on in the science he created and in the people he impacted along the way.</p>

	<p>I will be forever grateful for him in his help with what I call the sorting hat, i.e., scheduling interviews for our interview weekend.</p>
	<p>Lastly, he was a truly decent human being.  Too soon.</p>
	<p><b>—Joan Miller</b></p>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">The world lost a brilliant scientist when we lost James Taylor.  But more than that, we lost a genuinely kind and supportive person.  His scientific accolades are well known and widespread but I would like to share a couple of stories that showed that he was always willing to help – regardless of how busy he was and regardless of who you were.  Let me first say that from an administrative perspective, the ‘idea’ of working with James Taylor was intimidating – but as a person, intimidating would not be a word used to describe him.  I met James in 2013, when he was joining our department and wanted to submit a grant application prior to his arrival.  Not only was Computational Biology new to our department but this grant was unlike any I had submitted in my time in Biology.  A Center grant; across numerous disciplines; with performances sites across JHU and the country – and with James, not even relocated to MD yet.  It was a massive undertaking for our staff and while he expressed his appreciation at the time of submission, it surprised and impressed me that 5 years later, he used that experience at the end of a presentation he was asked to give for Research Administration Day.  Not only did he graciously agree to speak at this on-campus, administrative event, he ended his presentation with a picture of the six paper copies of that 600+ page U54 application that we had spread out on our conference room table, in preparation for shipping to the NIH.  He publicly expressed his appreciation for our efforts from before he arrived and our continued administrative support of his research.</p>
	<p align="justify">James also assisted me, personally, as I was completing my masters program.  I was required to interview a PI whose work involves multi-disciplinary projects.  The interview had to be recorded and I think he was more nervous to be on camera than I was!  He not only took the time for this interview but he spent some time with me afterwards to explain his path from computer science to computational biology and how he saw things growing and progressing.  Admittedly, I did not understand the science part of the conversation, but his passion for his research and particularly, his vision regarding the sharing of scientific information was inspiring and infectious.</p>
	<p align="justify">I know I speak for my entire staff when I say that James was a pleasure to know and will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him.  My heart goes out to Meredith, his family, lab and colleagues.</p>
	<p><b>—Donna Schriver</b></p>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<p align="justify">James’ was never the loudest voice in the department - he didn’t have to be. His successes and ingenuity spoke volumes for him. James didn’t need to boast his recent scientific discoveries or technical advances on the Galaxy project (though there were many). Instead, he used his voice to promote reproducible open-access science and inspire young scientists.</p>
	<p align="justify">James cared deeply about teaching the next generation of scientists to code and use ‘big data’ to answer scientific questions. He taught the computational biology bootcamp for the first year PhD students in our department. On my first day in this aptly named course, he asked that everyone open “terminal.” Immediately, I placed the pink sticky-note on my computer to signify that I was confused. I did not know what a “terminal” was. As the bootcamp progressed, my pink sticky-note never left my computer; I constantly needed extra assistance. James however wasn’t bothered. He knelt by my computer and explained both theory of computational biology and helped correct errors in my poorly written code. No question was too small or naïve for his attention. His desire to teach was profoundly evident. James did not assign deadlines for his assignments because he didn’t want a time pressure to impede students’ ability to learn. He preferred that a student take time to comprehend the material, at whatever pace was necessary, rather than submit an incomplete or incorrect assignment simply because it was “due.” This philosophy, to me, sums up James teaching doctrine perfectly.</p>
	<p align="justify">I am sorry that future biologists will not have the opportunity to learn directly from James Taylor. To honor him, we should all, as scientists, strive for reproducible open-access science and, as humans, demonstrate the qualities by which James lived in his daily life.</p>

	<p align="justify">James was on the forefront of genomics research, and yet, he had the time to build the next generation of genomics-competent graduate students from the ground up. No question was too small to ask him for help. And beyond that, he was selfless with collaborations with our lab [Johnston lab] and helped us every step of the way, big and small. He taught these traits in his students, who were also available, kind, and generous with their time. His magnanimity was the foundation for the collegiality I experienced at Hopkins - we all committed to be as open-sourced with our research as possible because he led with such a striking example. The loss of James is insurmountable to the scientific community, and devastating to us, as his friends and colleagues.</p>

	<p align="justify">I always heard stories about James Taylor, the infamous professor that was tasked with teaching all the biology Ph.D. students how to code. When I started the program, I realized James’ class would mean I’d have no choice but to give up all my Friday nights. Even though his class would end at 5pm, I would be so absorbed with the problems he assigned that I couldn’t stop coding until I finished everything. I quickly realized that he wasn’t just teaching us how to code, but rather he was teaching us how to decode biology. It’s unbearably tough to think that the next group of students won’t get the same experience. I find solace by knowing that he will live on through the countless decoding sessions myself and others will have.</p>

Whenever I was in his classroom, that factory feeling slipped away. James walked with us through his ideas. His lectures were more like a conversation, our thoughts and ideas were part of the discourse. Everything he did, he did it to empower us. From implementing our 1 week intensive bootcamp so that coding can be accesible to all incoming graduate students, to the little things, like the way he graded our exams to test us not on the "right answer" per se, but whether can we explain something confidently and logically.</p>
